# Walmart_Sales_Analysis

This project aims to analyze Walmart sales data using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. The "Walmart_dataset.csv" dataset was used to explore sales data from various Walmart stores and identify trends and patterns in customer behavior.

The project includes two Tableau files: "Walmart Sales Analysis full software access.twbx" and "Walmart Sales Analysis_visible_access.twb". The former file includes the full software access and allows users to interact with the dashboard to explore the data and gain insights. The latter file is a visible access file and can be used to view the dashboard without the ability to interact with the data.

The project dashboard includes various charts, graphs, and tables that provide insights into the sales data, including sales trends over time, top-selling products, sales by store, and sales by department. The data is presented in an interactive and visually appealing way to help users understand the data and identify areas for improvement.

This project aims to provide a practical application of data visualization tools such as Tableau to analyze and gain insights from large datasets. The code and dataset used in this project are available on GitHub for further exploration and replication.
